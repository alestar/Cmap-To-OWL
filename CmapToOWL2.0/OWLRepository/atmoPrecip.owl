 <owl:Class rdf:ID="FamilyOfTornadoes">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Tornado" />
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A sequence of long-lived tornadoes produced by a cyclic supercell storm. Tornadoes touch down at quasi-regular intervals (typically 45 min). Usually a new tornado develops in a new mesocyclone just after an old tornado has decayed in an old, occluded neighboring mesocyclone. Sometimes, two successive tornadoes may overlap in time for a few minutes. The two mesocyclones may rotate partially around each other. If the damage tracks of the tornadoes appear to form a wavy broken line, the family is classified as a series mode. In the more common parallel-mode family, the damage tracks are parallel arcs with each new tornado forming on the right side of its predecessor. The parallel mode is subcategorized into left turn and right turn, according to the direction in which the paths curve.</rdfs:comment>

The perceptually dominant wavelength of light from green thunderstorms ranges from blue- green to yellow-green. The purity of the color is generally low and the physical mechanism that causes the green appearance is not understood. Although green clouds often occur in conjunction with severe weather, there is no evidence to support anecdotal attributions of the cause of this green to specific characteristics of severe storms, such as hail or tornadoes.</rdfs:comment>

In the United States, this term is applied specifically to the region about the Great Lakes or the Great Salt Lake. More specifically, lake effect often refers to the generation of sometimes spectacular snowfall amounts to the lee of the Great Lakes as cold air passes over the lake surface, extracting heat and moisture, resulting in cloud formation and snowfall downwind of the lake shore.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Precipitation in the form of balls or irregular lumps of ice, always produced by convective clouds, nearly always cumulonimbus. An individual unit of hail is called a hailstone. By convention, hail has a diameter of 5 mm or more, while smaller particles of similar origin, formerly called small hail, may be classed as either ice pellets or snow pellets. Thunderstorms that are characterized by strong updrafts, large liquid water contents, large cloud-drop sizes, and great vertical height are favorable to hail formation. The destructive effects of hailstorms upon plant and animal life, buildings and property, and aircraft in flight render them a prime object of weather modification studies. In aviation weather observations, hail is encoded A.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A hurricane radar band of circular or spiral shape associated with a tropical cyclone (hurricane or typhoon). Made evident by radar observations, hurricane bands typically curve cyclonically inward toward the center of the storm. The bands may be classified as primary if they merge into the eyewall encircling the eye of the storm, or secondary if they are disconnected from the eyewall. Hurricane bands generally move slowly around the center of the storm in the direction of the hurricane circulation. See banded structure.</rdfs:comment>

In a storm-relative reference frame, the idealized signature is symmetric about the radar viewing direction with marked azimuthal shear across the core region between peak Doppler velocity values of opposite sign. Typical signatures consist of Doppler velocity differences of 25? 75 m s-1 across core diameters of 2?8 km, with resulting azimuthal shear values of 5 ? 10-3 s-1 to 2 ? 10-2 s-1.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A convective storm system usually composed of a cluster of ordinary convective cells at various stages of their life cycle. New cells within the convective system are generated primarily by either low-level convergence along a preexisting boundary, or by lifting at the leading edge of the system-scale cold pool that was produced by the previous cells. A multicell storm may have a lifetime of several hours, and may also have supercells incorporated as a part of the system as well.
