    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Alpine tundra is an ecozone that does not contain trees because it has high altitude. Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude on Earth. Alpine tundra also lacks trees, but the lower part does not have permafrost, and alpine soils are generally better drained than permafrost soils. Alpine tundra transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone are known as Krummholz. Alpine tundra occurs in an alpine zone</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Antarctic tundra occurs on Antarctica and on several Antarctic and subantarctic islands, including South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the Kerguelen Islands. Antarctica is mostly too cold and dry to support vegetation, and most of the continent is covered by ice fields. However, some portions of the continent, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula, have areas of rocky soil that support plant life. The flora presently consists of around 300-400 lichens, 100 mosses, 25 liverworts, and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica's two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia Antarctica) and Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. In contrast with the Arctic tundra, the Antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents. Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Tundra"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Arctic tundra occurs in the far Northern Hemisphere, north of the taiga belt. The word tundra usually refers only to the areas where the subsoil is permafrost, or permanently frozen soil. (It may also refer to the treeless plain in general, so that northern SÃ¡pmi would be included.) Permafrost tundra includes vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">In physical geography, tundra is an area where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. There are two types of tundra: Arctic tundra (which also occurs in Antarctica), and alpine tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> A mass of snow (perhaps containing ice and rocks) moving rapidly down a steep mountain slope. Avalanches may be characterized as loose and turbulent, or slab; either type may be dry or wet according to the nature of the snow forming it, although dry snow usually forms loose avalanches and wet snow forms slabs. A large avalanche sweeps a current of air along with and in front of it as an avalanche wind, which supplements its already tremendous destructive force. </rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Soil within which the moisture has predominantly changed to ice, the unfrozen portion being in vapor phase. Ice within the soil bonds (adfreezes) adjacent soil particles and renders frozen ground very hard. Permanently frozen ground is called permafrost. Dry frozen ground is relatively loose and crumbly because of the lack of bonding ice. Frozen ground is sometimes inadvisedly called frost or ground frost. </rdfs:comment>

It is ice that is at an intermediate stage between snow and glacial ice. Firn has the appearance of wet sugar, but has a hardness that makes it extremely resistant to shovelling. It generally has a density greater than 550 kg/mÂ³ and is often found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a glacier.</rdfs:comment>
