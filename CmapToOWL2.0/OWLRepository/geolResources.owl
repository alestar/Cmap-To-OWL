    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Coal is a readily combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. It is composed primarily of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#SubstanceForm"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Deposition is the geological process by which material is added to a landform or land mass. Fluids such as wind and water, as well as sediment gravity flows, transport previously eroded sediment, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Fossils  are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the remote past. Fossils vary in size from microscopic, such as single bacterial cells [2] only one micrometer in diameter, to gigantic (macroscopic), such as dinosaurs and trees many meters long and weighing many tons.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Hematite, also spelled as h√¶matite, is the mineral form of Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3), one of several iron oxides. Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and as corundum. Hematite is a mineral, colored black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined as the main ore of iron [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Mineral"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A mineraloid is a mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. For example, obsidian is an amorphous glass and not a crystal.

 <owl:Class rdf:ID="NaturalGas">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#FossilFuel"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Natural gas is a gas consisting primarily of methane. It is found associated with fossil fuels, in coal beds, as methane clathrates, and is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, and landfills. It is an important fuel source, a major feedstock for fertilizers, and a potent greenhouse gas. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An oil is a substance that is in a viscous liquid state ("oily") at ambient temperatures or slightly warmer, and is both hydrophobic (immiscible with water) and lipophilic (miscible with other oils, literally). This general definition includes compound classes with otherwise unrelated chemical structures, properties, and uses, including vegetable oils, petrochemical oils, and volatile essential oils. Oil is a nonpolar substance. [Wikipedia]</rdfs:comment>
