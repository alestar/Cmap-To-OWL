<P>
The distributed version includes morphological dictionaries for 
covered languages (English, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, and Italian):

<UL>
<LI>The Spanish dictionary was obtained from the 
      Spanish Resource Grammar project developed at the 
      Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and contains over 550,000
      forms corresponding to more than 76.000 lemma-PoS combinations.
      These data are distributed under their original Lesser General
      Public License For Linguistic Resources (LGPL-LR) license.
      See THANKS and COPYING files for further information.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Catalan dictionary is hand build and contains
      near 67,000 forms corresponding to more than
      7,400 different combinations lemma-PoS.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Galician dictionary was obtained from OpenTrad project
     (a nice open source Machine Translation project at <TT>     www.opentrad.org</TT>), and contains over 90,000
     forms corresponding to near 7,500 lemma-PoS combinations.
     These data are distributed under their original Creative Commons
     license, see THANKS and COPYING files for further information.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The English dictionary was automatically extracted from WSJ,
    with accurate manual post-edition and completion.
    It contains over 65,000 forms corresponding to some 40,000 
    different combinations lemma-PoS.    

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Italian dictionary is extracted from Morph-it! lexicon 
     developed the University of Bologna, and contains over 360,000
     forms corresponding to more than 40,000 lemma-PoS combinations.
     These data are distributed under their original Creative Commons
     license, see THANKS and COPYING files for further information.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Smaller dictionaries (Catalan and Galician) are expected to cover
    over 80% of open-category tokens in a text. Larger dictionaries
    are expected to cover between 90-95% of open-category tokens in a
    text.  For words not found in the dictionary, all open categories
    are assumed, with a probability distribution based on word
    suffixes, which includes the right tag for 99% of the words, and
    allow the tagger to make the most suitable choice based on tag
    sequence probability.

<P>
This version also includes WordNet-based sense dictionaries for covered languages,
    as well as some knowledge extracted from WordNet, such as semantic file codes, or 
    hypernymy relationships.

<UL>
<LI>The English sense dictionary is straightforwardly extracted from WN 1.6
     and therefore is distributed under the terms of WN license, as is all 
     knowledge extracted from WN contained in thos package. You'll
     find a copy in the LICENSES/WN.license file in the distribution tarball.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Catalan and Spanish sense dictionaries are extracted from EuroWordNet, and the
     reduced subsets included in this FreeLing package are distibuted under Gnu GPL,
     as the rest of the code and data in this package. Find a copy of the license
     in the LICENSES/GPL.license file.

<P>
See http://wordnet.princeton.edu for details on WordNet, 
   and http://www.illc.uva.nl/EuroWordNet for more information on EuroWordNet.
