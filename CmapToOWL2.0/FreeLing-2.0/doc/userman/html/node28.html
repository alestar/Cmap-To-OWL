Dependency parser heuristic rules file
</H1>

<P>
This file contains a set of heuristic rules to perform dependency
  parsing.

<P>
The file consists of four sections:
  sections: <code>&lt;GRPAR&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;GRLAB&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;SEMDB&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;VCLASS&gt;</code>,
  respectively closed by tags <code>&lt;/GRPAR&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;/GRLAB&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;/SEMDB&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;/VCLASS&gt;</code>.

<P>

 <UL>
<LI>Section <code>&lt;GRPAR&gt;</code> contains rules to complete the
    partial parsing provided by the chart parser. The tree is
    completed by combining chunk pairs as stated by the rules. Rules
    are applied from highest priority (lower values) to lowest
    priority (higher values), and left-to rigth.
    That is, the pair of adjacent chunks matching the most prioritary
    rule is found, and the rule is applied, joining both chunks in
    one. The process is repeated until only one chunk is left.
    Each line contains a rule, with the format:
<PRE>
  ancestor-label descendant-label label operation priority-spec
</PRE>
  where:
  
<UL>
<LI><code>ancestor-label</code> and <code>descendant-label</code> are the
    syntactic labels (either assigned by the chunk parser, or a
    new <code>label</code> created by some other completion rule) of two
    consecutive nodes in the tree.
</LI>
<LI><code>label</code> has two meanings, depending on the
    <code>operation</code> field value.
    For <code>top_left</code> and <code>top_right</code> operations, it states the
    label with with the root node of the resulting tree must be
    relabelled (``-'' means no relabelling).
    For <code>last_left</code> and <code>last_right</code> operations, it states the
    label that the node to be considered ``last'' must have to get the
    subtree as a new child. If no node with this label is found, the 
    subtree is attached as a new child to the root node.
</LI>
<LI><code>operation</code> is the way in which <code>ancestor-label</code>
    and <code>descendant-label</code> nodes are to be combined.
</LI>
<LI><code>priority-spec</code> is a specification of possible priority
     values for this rule, as detailed below. 
  
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For instance, the rule:
<PRE>
  np pp - top_left  20
</PRE>

<P>
states that if two subtrees labelled <code>np</code> and <code>pp</code> are
  found contiguous in the partial tree, the later is added as a new
  child of the former.

<P>
The supported tree-building operations are the following:
  
<UL>
<LI><code>top_left</code>: The right subtree is added as a daughter of the
   left subtree. The root of the new tree is the root of the left
   subtree. If a <code>label</code> value other than ``-'' is specified,
   the root is relabelled with that string.
</LI>
<LI><code>last_left</code>: The right subtree is added as a daughter of
   the last node inside the left subtree matching <code>label</code> value
   (or to the root if none is found). The root of the new tree is the
   root of the left subtree.
</LI>
<LI><code>top_right</code>: The left subtree is added as a new daughter
   of the right subtree. The root of the new tree is the root of the
   right subtree. If a <code>label</code> value other than ``-'' is
   specified, the root is relabelled with that string.
</LI>
<LI><code>last_right</code>:  The left subtree is added as a daughter of the
   last node inside the right subtree matching <code>label</code> value
   (or to the root if none is found). The root of the new
   tree is the root of the right subtree.
  
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The <code>priority-spec</code> part of a rule defines the priority that
   will rank the applicable rules. Rules with low priority values will
   be applied earlier.  The <code>priority-spec</code> consists of a list of
   zero or more pairs <code>context-condition value</code>, separated by
   semicolons.  The last item in the list is a single integer value,
   and is required (i.e. the simplest possible <code>priority-spec</code> is
   a single integer value). Each context condition in the list is
   checked in order, and the priority value for the first matching
   condition is used for the rule. If no condition in the list
   matches, the last single value is used.

<P>
The context conditions are a sequence of labels separated with
  underscores, each label must match the label of one chunk in the
  partial tree. The condition must include a label <code>$$</code> which
  will match the pair of chunks that activated the rule. An <code>*</code> label
  matches any chunk.

<P>
For instance, the rule:
<PRE>
  np pp - top_left vp_$$_adjp 20; $$_*_vp 10; 5
</PRE>
  will be activated when an adjacent pair <code>np pp</code> is found, and
  will be ranked with priority 20 provided there is a <code>vp</code> chunk
  to the left of the focus pair, and a <code>adjp</code> chunk to its
  right. If not, it will get a priority of 10 if there is a <code>vp</code>
  chunk at the second right position, with any chunk in the first. If
  none of those patterns are matched, the rule will be assigned a
  priority of 5.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Section <code>&lt;GRLAB&gt;</code> contains rules to label the
    dependences extracted from the full parse tree build with the
    rules in previous section:

<P>
Each line contains a rule, with the format:
<PRE>
  ancestor-label dependence-label condition1 condition2 ...
</PRE>

<P>
where:
  
<UL>
<LI><code>ancestor-label</code> is the label of the node which is
    head of the dependence.
</LI>
<LI><code>dependence-label</code> is the label to be assigned to the dependence
</LI>
<LI><code>condition</code> is a list of conditions that the dependence
    has to match to satisfy the rule.
  
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each <code>condition</code> has one of the forms:
<PRE>
  node.attribute = value
  node.attribute != value
</PRE>

<P>
Where <TT>node</TT> may be <TT>p</TT> for parent or <TT>d</TT> for descendant), and <TT>attribute</TT>
   is one of the following:
  
<UL>
<LI><code>label</code>: chunk label (or PoS tag) of the node.
</LI>
<LI><code>side</code>: (left or right) position of the specified node with respect to the other.
</LI>
<LI><code>lemma</code>: lemma of dathe node head word.
</LI>
<LI><code>class</code>: word class (see below) of lemma of the node head word.
</LI>
<LI><code>tonto</code>: EWN Top Ontology properties of the node head word.
</LI>
<LI><code>semfile</code>: WN semantic file of the node head word.
</LI>
<LI><code>synon</code>: Synonym lemmas of the node head word (according to WN).
</LI>
<LI><code>asynon</code>: Synonym lemmas of the node head word ancestors (according to WN).
  
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Note that since no disambiguation is requiered, the attributes dealing with semantic properties will be satisfied if any of the word senses matches the condition.

<P>
For instance, the rule:
<PRE>
verb-phr    subj    d.label=np*      d.side=left
</PRE>
  states that if a <code>verb-phr</code> node has a daughter to its left, with a label
  starting by <code>np</code>, this dependence is to be labeled as <code>subj</code>.

<P>
Similarly, the rule:
<PRE>
verb-phr    obj    d.label=np*  d.tonto=Edible  p.lemma=eat
</PRE>
  states that if a <code>verb-phr</code> node has <TT>eat</TT> as lemma, and a
  descendant with a label starting by <code>np</code> and with a <TT>    Edible</TT> property in EWN Top ontology, this dependence is to be
  labeled as <code>obj</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Section <code>&lt;SEMDB&gt;</code> is only necessary if the dependency labeling rules in section <code>&lt;GRLAB&gt;</code> use conditions on semantic values (that is, any of <code>tonto</code>, <code>semfile</code>, <code>synon</code>, or <code>asynon</code>).
  The section must contain two lines specifying two semantic information files, a <TT>SenseFile</TT> and a <TT>WNFile</TT>. The filenames may be absolute or relative to the location of the dependency rules file.
<PRE>
&lt;SEMDB&gt;
SenseFile ../senses16.db
WNFile    ../../common/wn16.db
&lt;/SEMDB&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The <EM>SenseFile</EM> must be a BerkeleyDB indexed file as described in the <A HREF="node46.html#senses-file">4.5</A> section.
   The <EM>WNFile</EM> must be a BerkeleyDB indexed file, obtained with the same procedure from a source plain text file. This file must contain a sense per line, with the following format:
<PRE>
synset:PoS  hypern:hypern:...:hypern  semfile  TopOnto:TopOnto:...:TopOnto
</PRE>

<P>
That is: the first field is the synset code plus its PoS, separated by a colon. The second field is a colon-separated list of its hypernym synsets. The third field is the WN semantic file the synset belongs to, and the last field is a colon-separated list of EuroWN TopOntology codes valid for the synset.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Section <code>&lt;CLASS&gt;</code> contains class definitions which may
   be used as attributes in the dependency labelling rules.

<P>
Each line contains a class assignation for a lemma, with two possible formats:
<PRE>
  class-name  lemma   comments
  class-name  "filename"   comments
</PRE>

<P>
For instance, the following lines assign to the class <code>mov</code>
   the four listed verbs, and to the class <code>animal</code> all lemmas
   found in <code>animals.dat</code> file.  In the later case, if the file
   name is not an absolute path, it is interpreted as a relative path
   based at the location of the heuristic rules file.

<P>
Anything to the right of the second field is considered a comment and ignored.
<PRE>
mov     go      prep= to,towards
mov     come    prep= from
mov     walk    prep= through
mov     run     prep= to,towards   D.O.

animal "animals.dat"
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
